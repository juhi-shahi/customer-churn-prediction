## 📈 Model Performance Comparison  
| Model               | Accuracy  | Precision | Recall  | F1-Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Logistic Regression** | **0.369** | 0.278   | 0.869   | 0.422    |
| **Decision Tree**       | **0.656** | 0.429   | 0.912   | 0.584    |
| **Random Forest**       | **0.735** | 0.000   | 0.000   | 0.000    |

---

## 🔍 Key Insights from Model Evaluation  
- **Logistic Regression** has **high recall (0.869)**, meaning it identifies **churned customers well**, but low precision.  
- **Decision Tree** performs **better overall**, with **higher accuracy (0.656)** and **balanced recall (0.912)**.  
- **Random Forest** achieves the **highest accuracy (0.735)** but **fails in precision and recall (0.0)**, possibly due to **class imbalance**.

## 💡 Next Steps & Improvements  
🔹 **Fix Class Imbalance:** Use **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** or **re-sampling techniques**.  
🔹 **Tune Hyperparameters:** Use **GridSearchCV** for Decision Tree & Random Forest.  
🔹 **Try Other Models:** Experiment with **XGBoost, SVM, or Neural Networks** for better performance.
